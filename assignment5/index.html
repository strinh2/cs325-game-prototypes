<h2>Asteroid Life</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A top-down space shooter in which the player gains access to more powerful weaponry the more damage they take.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Revenge. The theme is related to mechanic in the game where the player unlocks weapons the more the enemy damages them.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Keyboard, a little random but more deterministic, shooter and achiever.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
To have fun, and to play strategically by weighing risk and reward.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>

The player can use standard keyboard inputs (up, left, right) in order play move around in the world, and the ship will  drift through space for a little while before  losing velocity when not receiving input.
The user starts with a prototype ship that has a shield, and while the shield is at full power the user can only utilize standard bullets, which are shot with the spacebar. Once the player's shield is damaged to certain levels, the energy ouput formerly applied to the shield will instead be transferred to the experimental weapon systems.
The ship will have color identifiers matching the 3 shield levels, and as the player gain access to more of their arsenal, an image will appear at the bottom corner displaying the weapon. Each has unique
properties and the player can balance taking damage vs becoming more powerful. Generally however, the more powerful weapons will have a longer cooldown time and output more damage.
Unfortunately the additional features such as particle affects, movement based on acceleration and drag, varied enemies, more boss characters, healing, other power-ups, like speed boosts, invicibility, invisibility and so on were not completed on time :(

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
A revenge system, where the player gets more powerful the more damage they take from their enemies.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
The game mechanic of becoming more dangerous the closer the player is to death.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The player is in a secret military prototype spaceship that utilizes experimental shielding and laser technologies. The spaceship is an experimental ship under the Trump administration,
and due to a leak raiders are onto you during its maiden voyage, and are trying to either capture or if that fails, destroy the vessel. Beware however, the national security advisor is thought of having ties with the enemy
and there might be a surprise at the end of the journey.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
The setting/premise covers it.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
People who enjoy quick and simple space shooters
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Only the first level is designed thus far, and as a result the game is currently made to be fairly short, likely less than minute.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Ideally the player would minimize the damage taken until they unlock the third weapon, and then play it safe by staying far away from the enemy spawn zone.
Once the boss appears and players notice that the rockets are homing, hopefully the player will utilize the enemy raider ships as body shields, and play their weapons to their strengths,
ie use the weaker, high rate of fire weapons to destroy the missile and save the slower, more powerful weapons for actually damaging the enemy. Furthermore, while the raiders
constantly follow the player in an attempt to board or kamikaze (destruction on their part for impacting the shields), multiple raiders do not fire at the same time.
Therefore while allowing many to spawn over time may be bad in the beginning, this can maximize the fact that enemy missiles explode on friend and foe alike.
