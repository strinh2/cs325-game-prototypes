<h2>Asteroid Life</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
A sidescroller game about an Asteroid trying to survive the dangers of space.
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Asteroids, this is an iteration on my pass of digital assignment 1.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Keyboard, a little random but more deterministic.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
To have fun and watch your baby asteroid grow up.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
User the arrow keys to move the asteroid, but be careful, as an asteroid you will always drift in the current direction.  The asteroid grows in size by hitting other objects, but make sure its big enough to survive the impact!
That said, beware of the enemy space cowboys. They're hunting you down, and if they're larger than you, they can capture you on impact! They do however, die on impact if you're bigger than them, but beware, their ships
are not like other asteroids and will damage you even if you're bigger. 

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
A game where the player starts small, but grows bigger and gains more health on colliding with smaller obstacles. The goal is to hit 100 health and become an adult asteroid, however the player will have to balance their size as it will be much harder
to avoid the enemy bullets the bigger the player grows.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
-Game mechanic: The player grows on impacts with smaller objects, but can be destroyed by larger objects <br>
-Interactive Environment
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
The player is a young asteroid who is finally going out on his own. Unfortunately, in addition to the inherent dangers in space, space cowboys are out to harvest your valuable core ores.
Watch out for these despicable poachers as you grow into an adult asteroid by ramming into as many planets and asteroids as possible!
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
Be it taking an algorithms test or having space cowboys harvest your organs, life is difficult and full of hardships, 
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
People who have low expectations and enjoy space games.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
As long as the player can survive, or until they reach adulthood. Anywhere from ~15s to 3mins.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The main strategy that the player will employ should be using the environmental factors to destroy the enemy space cowboys. Stars destroy anything they come in contact with, planets
and other asteroids can destroy the space cowboys and their lasers if taken by surprise!
</li>
