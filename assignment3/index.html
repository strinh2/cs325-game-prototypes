<h2>Cuckoo for Choco Puffs</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
 The desperate struggle of a chocoa puff addict to hoard as many chcoa puffs as possible before they're caught by the authorities.
 </li><br>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
Invisibility and Someone who would do anything
</li><br>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
Keyboard, random, topdown,  and collector. While a bit deterministic, the game is random enough that if they are unlucky the plalyer can lose immediately, or survive for extremely long periods of time.
</li><br>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
To vicariously experience the dangers of addiction and learn to avoid it in real life.
</li><br>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Click and hold down the mouse!  Refresh to restart! <br> 
The goal is to collect as many choco puffs as possible, keeping in balance the constantly falling sugar levels versus exposing themselves to enemy spotlights.
<br> <i> Mind your sugar levels, if they drop too low the withdrawal symptoms will kick in and you will fall unconscious, meaning that you're guaranteed to be caught! </i>
</li><br>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The core mechanic being prototyped is that the spotlights follow and speed up when discovering the player's footsteps. This allows a level of danger but also strategy on
the players part. As each of the spotlights live a random amount of time, it also is based on  a great deal of your luck!
</li><br>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
-Spotlights follow marks left by the player when stumbling on it
-A level design with several-built in traps
-A cautionary tale of addiction and its dangers
-Satisfying walking in snow sound effects
-Delicious choco puffs
</li> <br>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
You are an average, every-day invisible man who has braved the harsh journey to reach the mecca of choco puffs: The rich and fertile land where choco puffs naturally
grow during prime harvesting season-the dead of winter. Your choco puff supply is running low, and security seems stricter than expected. Fortunately it is snowing,  and 
under the cover of the night your footsteps, the only hurdle in your infiltration of the compound,  disappear fairly quickly. Good luck, and don't forget to mind your sugar levels!
</li><br>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
You're addicted to choco puffs.
</li> <br>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
Anybody that has free time. Other than that, not a specific audience in particular. The game is short and sweet, and lends itself to pretty much anybody willing to give it a shot.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
Anywhere between a few seconds to a couple minutes, depending on some skill, but mostly luck. Don't do choco puffs at home kids, anything could happen.
</li> <br>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
As most aspects are randomized to a greater extent, some run throughs may be frustrating, however there are various strategies that can be used to maximize the score gained. For example, using the leftover footsteps in the snow to face different directions and thereby throw off the enemy spotlights (while increasing the risk of getting caught by running in  a circle), hiding in areas with greater mobility, and collecting cocoa puffs through walls in some instances are some examples.
