<h2>The Pet Parlor</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
    Maximize your profits by correctly matching the appropriate pet for each client but hurry, if you take too long they may take their business elsewhere!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
The theme is from the Pet Shop chosen in class.
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
All dragging and dropping with the mouse. Lots of random factors, but the game is deterministic by nature.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
    To have a feeling of accomplishment as you sell living creatures for monetary benefit, to have fun matching orders to appropriate customers to maximize profit, and to enjoy a different, personalized experience depending on the player choices in clients.
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
Drag and drop petes with matching characteristics to the appropriate order. Each client will have a brief description including their preferences and monetary value with each successful 
    match. Make as much money as possible before the fad runs out, but be careful, if you get too many orders wrong then it's also game over!

</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The goal is to build upon basic matching games by including incentives and ramifications of supplying certain clients.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
-Game mechanic: A system that rewards or punishes the player based on decisions made in selecting clients, all the while under
    the time pressure of maximizing profits in a matching game.
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
    The trading and selling of soft fuzzy animals has blown up, and as an enterprising individual, you have decided to profit off the craze with animal pris-shop of your own, but be careful, it's a rough business
    and criminal activity has risen recently in the area.
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
Covered in the setting.
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
People who have low expectations and enjoy matching games.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
As long as the player can survive, which can be anywhere from 30s to several minutes
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
The main strategy will probably be to avoid the dangerous (and more profitable clients) until the very end and farm the cheaper, safer clients, and then hit as many risky clients as possible right after a police officer leaves.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>

<li>Clients: Self Made</li>

</ul>
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
It took significantly longer than I anticipated to program all of the basic rules and gameplay mechanics in digital form, and as a result I didn't get to implementing as many features and polish as I wanted.
