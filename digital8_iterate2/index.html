<h2>A Chilling Cover Up</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
    A point and click adventure where the player is acting from the great beyond to stop his friends/family from witnessing the memories of his hidden crimes being played on the TV!
</li>

<li><strong>Theme:</strong>
The theme is from the "TV showing actual memories"
</li>

<li><strong>Mandated Variety:</strong>
All dragging and dropping/clicking with the mouse. The game is deterministic with very few random factors involved.
</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
   To enjoy interacting with the environment as a ghost!  The goal of the game is to prevent the television from playing out the memory sequence of your criminal act before the time runs out 
</li>

<li><strong>Gameplay:</strong>
The game will be single-player, point and click-using a mouse to click on objects to interact with them or even drag some of the lighter objects. The cost will be loosely based on the player's common knowledge, weight of the object and nature of the interaction. For example clicking a button would take a lot less energy than beating something with a baseball bat.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Goal:</strong>
The goal is to make a point and click adventure game based on a different premise with a time and energy constraints in order to solve a puzzle.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
<ul>
<li>Game mechanic: Decision-based puzzle solver limited by time and energy constraints.</li>
<li> An intuitive, interactive environment that will ideally mold the player experience.
</ul>
<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
    You have finally passed through the boundaries of life and death…only to find that you have become a ghost, unable to leave your old home. The afterlife isn’t paradise however, for as soon as you regain consciousness you realize that the old TV in your home is mysteriously replaying your memories…and you only have a few minutes before it reveals your most heinous crime right in front of your loved ones! Quick, to preserve your loved ones’ memories of who you were and to prevent them from learning the truth, you must stop them from watching before it’s too late!
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
Covered above^
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
People who have very low expectations and enjoy simple click and point puzzles.
</li>

<li><strong>Play Time:</strong>
The base time currently is 60 seconds, but the time can be extended through distractions, as so long as the player can distract the audience for, which can be anywhere from an extra 5-30 seconds.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
Players will most likely use their inherent knowledge of objects to maximize their AP use-avoiding bigger objects at the beginning and utilizing the smaller, easier objects to cause distractions first to gain more time and AP before attempting to move/interact with the bigger objects. Also, players will likely do the same thing for the objects whose interactions would take more effort in real life as well-for example interacting with knife will take more energy than moving a vase, because the vase simply needs to be pushed over, meanwhile the knife will have to be picked up and thrown to have any real effect on the environment. That said repeat players who didn’t manage to solve the puzzle the first time will likely realize that they are able to interact with the objects whose AP cost they aren’t aware of at the very beginning-losing minimal AP while gaining perfect knowledge on how much each object costs and the result of each object at the beginning of the game. While this strategy will still be useable in the digital version, it won’t be as effective since each item will only display its AP cost, and not the effect it will have unless the action is successful.

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
The first major difference is the clearing up of the descriptions on the interactive screen by making them gradually disappear over time. In order to make the game cleaner and easier to read and play, a new sidebar has been introduced
displaying all of the relevant information and hints for each of the items that have been interacted with so far, which makes it easier for the player to understand the game even though they have been thrown in media res. On the creative side,
I have included hints to alternative endings (which can be found with alternative solutions to the puzzle) which will encourage replayability with the audience and hold their interest in the game. To further encourage replayability
and overall to make the game a bit more enjoyable for the audience I tweaked the game values as well, including changes to the amount of GP gained and lost, making it a little less difficult for first time players while
 making the solution options a bit stricter to encourage exploring the environment with those replaying the game (for example increasing the cost of grabbing and using the knife, however making sure that the game punishes less if you fail). The panel also implicitly allows the player to know that they have discovered everything when all the open
spaces are filled up and should give the player a feeling of accomplishment for discovering all of the distractions and interactable objects while allowing them to focus on solving the puzzle towards the end of the playthrough. Also made some minor tweaks
with the sound to emphasize the more prominent sound effects to make the game creepier!
